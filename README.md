### Project Eighteen - 100DaysOfCode
# Simple Calculator
This is a simple program (calculator) that collects two user inputs and performs a user selected operation on them.

## Background
This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode learning streak. I intend to write a simple python program each day. Each project would:
* be heavily commented for learning purposes;
* include a README file similar to this one;
* include an algorithm to solve it without code;
* include a summary of what I learnt.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Define functions to perform the various operations.
3. Create a variable and assign it the user input for a selected operation.
4. Create two variables to hold the operands from the uer.
5. Using if/in and if/else if/else statements, evaluate the user input in line 3 and 4.
6. Print the answer to the screen.
7. Stop.

*NB: Create checks at various points, to evaluate user input. This is to ensure that the required values are being passed from the user input into the various variables.*

## What I've learnt
* This program, just like **[Project 15](https://github.com/iamnvna/guess-the-word)** improved my use of if/else if/else and 'if ... in ...' statement use.
* I applied the python error handling technique in the code. 
* I explored further the use of functions in this code: I've come to understand the use of global variables better. This was a challenge in **[Project 14](https://github.com/iamnvna/adventure-game).**
